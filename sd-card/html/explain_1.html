    <h4>Step 1 / 7: Adjust Focus and Verify Flashlight</h4>
    First, find a proper mounting position for your device.  You may have to have to adjust the camera lens focus to
    get a sharp, crisp image.  Use the <b>live stream with LED flash</b> to complete this step.  Details on camera lens
    adjustment can be found here:
    <a href=https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/Reference-Image/#focus target=_blank>Focus Adjustment</a><br>
    Verify that reflections from the LED do not interfere with the readability of data areas.   External
    LEDs are supported if proper illumination cannot be obtained using the onboard LED.   See the documentation for details.

    <p>The flash intensity defaults to 50%, but can be changed in the next step.  You can return to
    this screen after making adjustments.<br>
    This live stream can also be called at any time after setup is complete.</p>
