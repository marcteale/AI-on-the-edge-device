    <h2>Welcome to AI-on-the-edge Device Setup</h2>

    <p>
        This is AI-on-the-edge's <b>initial setup procedure</b>.  The basic setup consists of seven steps, after which your device will reboot into the regular web interface.<br />
        Note: All initial configuration settings are also accessible using the regular web interface.
        See the <a href=https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/initial-setup target=_blank>documentation </a> for additional information.</p>
    </p>
    <p> You can navigate during setup with the "Next Step" and "Previous Step" buttons.<br>
        The "Abort Setup" button will skip setup and you will be sent to the abort screen.<br>
        To restart, use the "Restart Setup" button.
    </p>
    <p>
        Setup procedure overview:
    </p>    
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li><p><b>Adjust focus and check for LED reflections.</b><br>
        Ensure your camera lens is properly focused and the LED does not create reflections that interfere with readings.
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Create the reference image.</b><br>
        This is the base for position referencing and the identification of digits and counters.
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Define two unique alignment markers</b>.<br>
        Alignment markers are used to orient images before further processinig.
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Define regions of interest (ROI's) for digits</b>.<br>
        These will be used to digitize numerical parts of your meter.<br>
        (Can be skipped if your meter does not have numerical indicators.)
    </p></li>
    <li><b>Define ROI's for analog counters.</b><br>
        These will be used to digitize analog parts (dials) of your meter.<br>
        (Can be skipped if your meter does not have analog counters.)
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Additional configuration.</b><br>
        Any additional configuration can be done here. This can also be performed later with regular web interface, e.g. 
        setting up publishing services like MQTT.
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Setup Completion. End/Abort setup mode.</b><br>
        Setup must be properly terminated on this page or you will sent back to setup after rebooting.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>

<p>Please be patient between steps. Devices can take quite some time to load all necessary information!</p>
